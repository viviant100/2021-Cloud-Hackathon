title: Create Hackathon GitHub Team
---

This was used to automate adding 41 github usernames to the cloud hackathon github team. Further refinement needed

Automated kyber here: <https://github.com/openscapes/kyber>

```{r}
# First make sure to set your GitHub PAT
Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "")

# usethis::create_github_token()

library(kyber) # remotes::install_github("openscapes/kyber@main")
library(rmarkdown)
library(tibble)
library(fs)
library(datapasta)

members <-   tibble::tribble(
# pasted here from internal spreadsheet 
#                        ~Name,      ~GitHub_username,

)

## ideally, strip any "@"s and remove NAs
# for the moment did this by hand.

team_name <- "2021-cloud-hackathon-participants"

ky_create_team(team_name, org = "nasa-openscapes", maintainers = "jules32")

ky_add_team_members(team_name, members = members$GitHub_username, org = "nasa-openscapes")


```
